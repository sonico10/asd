							"Very gradually, by degrees, pale blue hues invade the quiet of night, and Hammerer knows that only a few hours remain until dawn. Throughout the afternoon, evening, and night, he has meticulously inspected his tools, a wide array of mallets, sledges, and, of course, hammers, cleaning them, performing repairs, and organizing them by size and by color, only powering down for a few hours in the middle of the night.",
							"Through the walls of his workshop, Hammerer can see the heat signatures of people waking up and preparing breakfast; he performs a similar ritual, polishing his chassis and running diagnostics for the day ahead. Mentally, he has a checklist of duties and chores before he begins the day's work.",
							"Finally, the clocks strike seven, and Hammerer leaves his home, a room barely ten feet square, and heads out into the town. Somewhere in the market, a child cries for his mother to buy him a toy, and Hammerer puzzles at this behavior; work, after all, is far more interesting than frivolity."

							"The vect were preceded by unthinking golems of various designs but, though they are still constructed rather than born, they are now fully living beings. Underneath their armored exteriors lies an organically-influenced anatomy, with a circulatory system crafted from leather piping and a network of magic nerves. At the core of each vect unit is an everlasting construct core, tinged with the influence of the Spark that awoke them.",
							"Vect bodies are humanoid in shape, but unmistakably mechanical, with large air intakes, protective shoulderplates, toothless jaws, and glowing mechanical eyes. Though each of the Foundries produces its vect in slightly unique proportions, the general shape is always the same, and vect can normally scavenge spare parts from the deceased if they are ever grievously injured. In fact, many vect choose to install specially-designed embedded components to improve their bodies, up to and including replacing limbs with appropriate tools. If a vect unit is preparing for a dangerous journey, their preparation will likely include purchasing embedded components as replacement parts.",
							"Vect can work tirelessly and never need to sleep, instead entering a dreamless period of inactivation each day. Most vect create endless lists of goals and chores, taking comfort in the sequence and monotony of tasks to break up the endless march of days, weeks, and months. It is not uncommon to see a vect standing watch over his party, sharpening tools and repairing armor while the others sleep."

							"Although vect units experience the same fear, anger, pain, loss, and other emotions that humanoids do, their expression of them is muted. Neither do their mechanical faces and harsh, metallic voices endear themselves, driving a wedge between vect and most other living things. Many vect, therefore, seek refuge in logical thinking. Some become emotionally distant and lack introspection, whereas others plumb the philosophies of existence and consider what it means to be alive. These become the two extremes, between vect who seek to embrace their status as living things, and those who wish to banish all within themselves that is not construct. The vast majority of vect exist between these extremes.",
							"Vect are most comfortable existing within a small group of some kind, as long as it is dedicated to a purpose. Temples, adventuring parties, and voyages of exploration are deeply attractive to the vect."

And while there is no doubt that vect are alive, the destination of their souls upon death is another matter entirely. The philosophical implications of this are not lost on them, and the questions of existence echo loudly inside some vect. ",
							"Though the Foundries are intelligent beyond measure, they are wordless in their duties, and ascribe no grand meaning to their creations.",
							"Some vect find comfort in faith, normally worshipping gods of arcana, smiths, and constructs. Others seek permanent distraction in quests and chores. Others still look to the 'verse for answers, and seek meaning through understanding."
