Some speak of an ancient Yuan-ti king who in their last moments, cursed the group of humans taking over his dying kingdom. Others tell the tale how a town of people decided to make their way into the Feywild, only to return screaming as their hair turned into scaly tendrils. Few believe the oldest saga of how Lutra, goddess of all animals bewitched a gathering of human soldiers, trying to destroy one of the ancient forests for timber."

Unlike monsterous medusas, veneris aren't inherently evil but have been brutally hunted for their incredibly rare venom and hardy scales. Although they are more intelligent than most races by nature, they have been forced out of civilization due to their hideous appearance.",
						"Veneris usually wear rags, tattered cloth and leather. Even the wealthy individuals prefer silky cloths, wispy dresses and light robes instead of layered clothing or armor.",

Due to their natural quick wits that is usually used to counteract their looks, they climb the ranks of the social ladder rather quickly and may even be able to become nobles in a city. After gaining some influence and most importantly a roof above their heads, these veneris invite others who can't integrate into civilization as well as they can, helping them live a better life."

They eventually shed their scales and their tail splits and gradually forms into feet as they learn to walk around at the age of four. Though a veneris might mate with other races there is a higher chance that the child will resemble the veneris parent rather than the other ancestor.",
						"Veneris are often despised or feared, so they train their children in combat. From an early age they train their kids how to hunt small animals or steal from the busy streets of civilized land.
