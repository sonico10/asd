While growing, the greatest silva warriors are tasked to protect the Nine from anyone who seeks to hurt them in their vegetative state. When reborn, they do not initially remember their past lives. If they are discovered early, they can be “trained” to remember their past within a few months. For those that are not found early, they slowly regain memories over the course of 2-5 years. The Nine are considered gods on earth, and they are given the divine right to rule, considering their millennia of experience."

On a failure the target is charmed by you. If a creature is immune to being charmed it automatically succeeds. When a creature is charmed in this way, it is compelled to use all of its movement to go towards the source of the sound on its next turn, after which it acts normally."
