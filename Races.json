						"Little to no information exists as to why veneris became the wicked-looking, snake skinned people they are today. The most prevalent are three myths that spread through word of mouth. Some speak of an ancient Yuan-ti king who in their last moments, cursed the group of humans taking over his dying kingdom. Others tell the tale how a town of people decided to make their way into the Feywild, only to return screaming as their hair turned into scaly tendrils. Few believe the oldest saga of how Lutra, goddess of all animals bewitched a gathering of human soldiers, trying to destroy one of the ancient forests for timber."

						"Veneris are usually not pleasant to the eye of an outsider. They are slim, mostly human skinned individuals, with snake-like coils in place of their hair and a venomous bite alike to a skake's. Unlike monsterous medusas, veneris aren't inherently evil but have been brutally hunted for their incredibly rare venom and hardy scales. Although they are more intelligent than most races by nature, they have been forced out of civilization due to their hideous appearance.",
						"Veneris usually wear rags, tattered cloth and leather. Even the wealthy individuals prefer silky cloths, wispy dresses and light robes instead of layered clothing or armor.",
						"Those who have an affinity with natural magic dress themselves in decorative fungi, allowing them to be further in tune with mother nature."

						"Some veneris scout around towns and small cities, finding the bare minimum to survive.They don't involve themselves much with society since their unnatural appearance. Struggling to live a day to day life, these veneris have a natural talent for staying hidden from sight.",
						"Many of them however, merge into human society hiding their true selves. They cover up their hair with large cloths and scarfs or mask their body with magic. Due to their natural quick wits that is usually used to counteract their looks, they climb the ranks of the social ladder rather quickly and may even be able to become nobles in a city. After gaining some influence and most importantly a roof above their heads, these veneris invite others who can't integrate into civilization as well as they can, helping them live a better life."

						"Veneris are always born in groups of three from eggs lain by their mother. When they are born, veneris have a snake-like tail and sometimes scales instead of skin on some parts of their body. They eventually shed their scales and their tail splits and gradually forms into feet as they learn to walk around at the age of four. Though a veneris might mate with other races there is a higher chance that the child will resemble the veneris parent rather than the other ancestor.",
						"Veneris are often despised or feared, so they train their children in combat. From an early age they train their kids how to hunt small animals or steal from the busy streets of civilized land. This is also the time when the more powerful veneris discover their ability to employ a gaze that turns those who behold them to stone."
